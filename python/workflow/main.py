    # The pre_modification() and post_modification() callbacks are optional,
    # and are invoked outside FASTMAP. pre_modification() is invoked before
    # create, update, or delete of the service, as indicated by the enum
    # ncs_service_operation op parameter. Conversely
    # post_modification() is invoked after create, update, or delete
    # of the service. These functions can be useful e.g. for
    # allocations that should be stored and existing also when the
    # service instance is removed.
